# Manage Hints
This command allows staff to set and view plot hints on characters. These should be unique secrets that tie into TPs or the game's metaplot.

`hints <name>` - Show existing hints for character.
`hints/set <name>=<hint>` - Set the hints field for character. Will overwrite existing hints.
`hints/add <name>=<hint>` - Adds a new hint to the character. Will not overwrite existing hints.
`hints/edit <name>` - Pulls the existing hints into your output for editing.
`hints/all` - Lists all characters who have hints set.
`hints/blank` - Lists all character objects without hints (can be spammy!).

Requires view_bgs permission to view and set other player hints.
